#### Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews Using Machine Learning Techniques; Rajkumar S. Jagdale, Vishal S. Shirsat and Sachin N. Deshmuk
* Amazon product reviews: Camera, Laptops, Mobile phones, tablets, TVs, video surveillance (approx 13k total reviews)
* Classified reviews as positive or negative
* Naïve Bayes: 98.17% accuracy, SVM: 93.54% for Camera Reviews
* Process Overview:
  * Split review by sentence
  * Preprocess each sentence (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, punctuation marks removal)
  * Convert to bag of words (BOW)
  * Calculate sentiment score by comparing BOW with opinion lexicon
  * ML on sentiment scores
* Future work: aspect level analysis could improve (e.g. Camera’s quality, megapixel, picture size, structure, lens, picture quality, etc.)
